# Unix File System Simulator  

Implemented a C program to navigate through a simulated file system with files and directories, storing metadata as a simplified inode (an index and a type- dir/file)

  *run instructions: (1) make , (2) ./fs_simulator <file_name>  
    note: this project includes two folders to try this with. An empty folder “empty” and a test folder “fs”
  
programmed the linux commands 
cd [name] , ls , mkdir [name] , touch [name] , exit
  
TAKEAWAYS:
* manipulated pointers and arrays in C
* practiced reading and writing to files
* broke down a large-scale project into smaller tasks
